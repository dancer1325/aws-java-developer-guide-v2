    * [provide temporary credentials directly](#credentials-temporary-from-portal)
  * recommended by AWS

## IAM Identity Center configuration<a name="credentials-temporary-idc"></a>

* if you [configure the SDK / use IAM Identity Center single sign-on access](setup-basics.md)
  * -> SDK automatically uses temporary credentials
    * how does it work?
      * SDK -- via the IAM Identity Center access token, gain access to the -- IAM role / is configured with the `sso_role_name` | your `config` 
      * SDK 
        * assumes this IAM role
        * -- retrieves -- temporary credentials

**Set up a local credentials file for temporary credentials**

1. [Create a shared credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-location.html)

1. In the credentials file, paste the following placeholder text until you paste in working temporary credentials\.

   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id=<value from AWS access portal>
   aws_secret_access_key=<value from AWS access portal>
   aws_session_token=<value from AWS access portal>
   ```

1. Save the file\. The file `~/.aws/credentials` should now exist on your local development system\. This file contains the [\[default\] profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html#file-format-profile) that the SDK for Java uses if a specific named profile is not specified\. 

1. [Sign in to the AWS access portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtosignin.html)

1. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtogetcredentials.html) to copy IAM role credentials from the AWS access portal\.
**Note**  
Although the title of the page reads *Getting IAM role credentials for CLI access*, the instructions apply to the SDK for Java and also the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\.

   1. For step 2 in the instructions, choose the AWS account and IAM role name that grants access for your development needs\. This role typically has a name like **PowerUser** or **Developer**\.

   1. For step 4, select the option that reads **Add a profile to your AWS credentials file** and copy the contents\.

1. Paste the copied credentials into your local `credentials` file and remove the generated profile name\. Your file should resemble the following\.

   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
   aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
   aws_session_token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2IQoJb3JpZ2luX2IQoJb3JpZ2luX2IQoJb3JpZ2luX2IQoJb3JpZVERYLONGSTRINGEXAMPLE
   ```

1. Save the `credentials` file\.

When the SDK for Java creates a service client, it will access these temporary credentials and use them for each request\. The settings for the IAM role chosen in step 5a determine [how long the temporary credentials are valid](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtosessionduration.html)\. The maximum duration is twelve hours\.

After the temporary credentials expire, repeat steps 4 through 7\.
